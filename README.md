Technology : Deep Learning with Neural network using Python
Description :
### Hunting Naval Mines with Deep Learning
Mine detection and classification using side scan sonar imagery was a challenging problem.
As opposed to the majority of techniques, several Neural-network-based methods for the detection and classification of mines and mine-like objects were proposed.
Detection and classification of underwater objects in sonar imagery was a complicated problem, due to various factors such as variations in operating and environmental conditions, the presence of spatially varying clutter, and variations in target shapes, compositions, and orientation.
By using the concept of Deep Learning with Neural network we predicted whether the object is Mine or not.

## Libraries used :

  -sklearn for splitting the data into training and testing data, and for label encoding

  -pandas for reading the sonar.csv dataset

  -matplotlib for plotting and

  -tensorflow as the base ML library
  
  
## A Brief Introduction to The Problem
  
Thereâ€™s no doubt that mines represent an important issue to the navigability of the oceans. There are many of them laying around since several decades ago. The cost of producing and laying a mine is usually between 0.5% and 10% of the cost of removing it, and it can take up to 200 times as long to clear a minefield as to lay it. There still exist some naval minefields dating back to the World War II, and will remain dangerous for many years, since they are too extensive and expensive to clear.
